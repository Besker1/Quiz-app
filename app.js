  trivia: [
    "Light travels at a speed of 299,792 kilometers per second; 186,287 miles per second. It takes 499.0 seconds for light to travel from the Sun to the Earth, a distance called 1 Astronomical Unit.",
    "Uranus is the seventh planet from the Sun, orbiting at a distance of 2.88 billion km. But itâ€™s still much closer than Neptune, which averages a distance of 4.5 billion km from the Sun.",
    "The Moon has much weaker gravity than Earth, due to its smaller mass, so you would weigh about one sixth (16.5%) of your weight on Earth. This is why the lunar astronauts could leap and bound so high in the air.",
    "Jupiterâ€™s interior is made of rock, metal, and hydrogen compounds. Below Jupiterâ€™s massive atmosphere (which is made primarily of hydrogen), there are layers of compressed hydrogen gas, liquid metallic hydrogen, and a core of ice, rock, and metals.",
    "Mars has a very thin atmosphere. The resulting atmospheric pressure is only about 1% of that found at sea level on Earth. That is the equivalent pressure found at 35 km above the Earthâ€™s surface.",
